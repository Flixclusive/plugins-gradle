     * The **super fucking** unique identifier of the provider.

     * **IMPORTANT:** The ID **MUST** be **super unique**.
     * Providers have no centralized database to track or validate IDs, meaning there is no guarantee that your chosen ID
     * has not been taken by another developer. This creates the possibility of ID conflicts, which can lead to serious
     * issues in functionality.
     *
     * This id will be used for provider updates, order management, and local storage purposes. Changing IDs on different builds/updates will cause update and backport issues. SO MAKE SURE YOUR ID IS A CONSTANT VALUE!
     *
     * **Guideline:** Put in significant effort to create a **VERY VERY UNIQUE ID** to minimize the risk of collisions.
     *
     * This ID must adhere to the following constraints:
     * - It must be at least 8-25 characters long.
     * - It must contain alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers).
     * - It can optionally include symbols for additional complexity.
     *
     * If the above constraints are not met, the build will *throw* an error, preventing further compilation.
